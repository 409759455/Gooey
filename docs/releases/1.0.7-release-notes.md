## Gooey 1.0.6 Released! 



Quality of Life improvements for Gooey Options. 

Goal is to enable more IDE auto-completion help as well as more REPL driven usefulness via help() and docstrings. 

Gooey now exposes a top-level set of public gooey_option data constructors. 

```python
from gooey import options

parser.add_argument(
    '--foo', 
    help='Some foo thing',
    widget='FilterableDropdown',
    gooey_options=options.FilterableDropdown(
        placeholder='Search for a Foo',
        search_strategy=options.PrefixSearchStrategy(
            ignore_case=True 
        )
    ))
``` 

Note that these are _just_ helpers for generating the right data shapes. They're still generating plain data behind the scenes and thus all existing gooey_options code remains 100% compatible. 

**Better Docs:**

Which is to say, documentation which actually exists rather than _not_ exist. You can inspect the docs live in the REPL or by hopping to the symbol in editors which support such things. 

```
>>> from gooey import options 
>>> help(options.RadioGroup) 
Help on function FileChooser in module __main__:

FileChooser(wildcard=None, default_dir=None, default_file=None, message=None, **layout_options)
    :param wildcard: Sets the wildcard, which can contain multiple file types, for 
                     example: "BMP files (.bmp)|.bmp|GIF files (.gif)|.gif"
    :param message:  Sets the message that will be displayed on the dialog.
    :param default_dir: The default directory selected when the dialog spawns 
    :param default_file: The default filename used in the dialog
    
    Layout Options:
    ---------------
    
    Color options can be passed either as a hex string ('#ff0000') or as
    a collection of RGB values (e.g. `[255, 0, 0]` or `(255, 0, 0)`)
    
    :param label_color:    The foreground color of the label text
    :param label_bg_color: The background color of the label text.
    :param help_color:     The foreground color of the help text.
    :param help_bg_color:  The background color of the help text.
    :param error_color:    The foreground color of the error text (when visible).
    :param error_bg_color: The background color of the error text (when visible).
    :param show_label:     Toggles whether or not to display the label text
    :param show_help:      Toggles whether or not to display the help text
    :param visible:        Hides the entire widget when False. Note: the widget
                           is still present in the UI and will still send along any
                           default values that have been provided in code. This option
                           is here for when you want to hide certain advanced / dangerous
                           inputs from your GUI users.
    :param full_width:     This is a layout hint for this widget. When True the widget
                           will fill the entire available space within a given row.
                           Otherwise, it will be sized based on the column rules
                           provided elsewhere. 
```


Previously, Gooey Options have been an opaque map. While great of openness / extenisibility, it's pretty terrible from a "what does this actually take..?" perspective.  


Ideally, and eventually, we'll be able to completely type these options to increase visibility / usability even more. However, for backwards compatibility reasons, Gooey will continue to be sans types for the time being.



### Gooey Options: placeholder 

Widgets with text inputs now all accept a `placeholder` Gooey option. 

```python
add_argument('--foo', widget='TextField', gooey_options=options.TextField(
    placeholder='Type some text here!'
)
```

### New Widget: IntegerField 

### New Widget: DecimalField

### New Widget: Slider 


### New Validator option: RegexValidator
